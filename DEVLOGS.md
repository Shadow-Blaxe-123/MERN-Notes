Of course it was too good to be true. I had to spend hours just to get **Typecript** to get to work. What a way to start the project.

### 13/6/2025

I am starting on the front end because it will be easier, as I have more experience in this side. So I just had to restart the entire front end from scratch because both Tailwind and DaisyUI brand new buggy versions and I installed those at first.

So after hours wasting to configure it, I removed DaisyUI. I will stick to raw Tailwind for now.

Restarting the entire project.

Alright I have completed the set up for the backend. Time to get started. A basic server has been set up.
