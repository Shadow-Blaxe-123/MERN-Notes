# A MERN Stack App

This will be my first serious fullstack app, after the failure that was the E-commerce project. Well not failure per say. I just abandoned the project after building the frontend. I abandoned programming as a whole. Lets hope this goes better.

I amstating on the front end because it will be easier, as I have more experience in this side.
