# A MERN Stack App

This will be my first serious fullstack app, after the failure that was the E-commerce project. Well not failure per say. I just abandoned the project after building the frontend. I abandoned programming as a whole. Lets hope this goes better.

Of course it was too good to be true. I had to spend hours just to get **Typecript** to get to work. What a way to start the project.

I am starting on the front end because it will be easier, as I have more experience in this side. So I just had to restart the entire front end from scratch because both Tailwind and DaisyUI brand new buggy versions and I installed those at first.

So after hours wasting to configure it, I removed DaisyUI. I will stick to raw Tailwind for now.
